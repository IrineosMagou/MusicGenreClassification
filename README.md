# Music Genre Classification
Training Neural Networks to classify four different music genres.

### Description
This project works on genre prediction from music signals using neural networks. Specifically, the goal is to classify 1 second of music signal into the following genres: classical, pop, rock, and blues. 

First, a simple FeedForward NN is used and then a Convolutional NN, comparing the differences on evaluation metrics and efficiency. Also the The CNN is slowly growing in both layers and operations so the differences and the needs emerge.

The two NN are separated into two Jupyter(.ipynb) Notebooks with the corresponding names, including their code and explanations of each step. For each 1 second of the sound signal the two NN are using different representations, the FF NN is using MFCCs and the CNN mel-spectograms.
The Framework for this project is *PyTorch* which is a powerful and flexible open-source machine learning framework primarily used for building and training deep neural networks.
